# VCOM-FEUP - Proj2

[Report](https://github.com/JoaoAbelha/VCOM-3D-Data-Acquisition/blob/main/Proj2/report.pdf)

In this project we were able to explore different methodologies and techniques used in image classification, as well as experiments with the state of the art architectures. Due to the nature of this problem we were faced with several difficulties, from data imbalance to different image shapes, which allowed to explore and broaden our knowledge on this field. 

Convolutional Neural Networks are the standard approach to image processing applications, however we got surprising results when applying a Support Vector Machine to our dataset, which is very interesting and further work could be done in that direction. Also, noise removal could also be implemented as future work, by training an initial model and removing entries for which the error is considerably high, and then use that data as training data, extracting outliers from the dataset. 

This are some ideas regarding future work, however overall the work developed showed how Convolutional Neural Networks, either being used as transfer learning model either as feature extractor, play a big role in image application and processing, being capable of real context application.
